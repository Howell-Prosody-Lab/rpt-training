Go to Model Retraining to get to the code to retrain the models.

There are two folders that are needed. A folder for pitch CSVs, and a folder for intensity CSVs.
The CSVs that are created with the model will run fine with this code. 

The columns for the features in the CSVs are:
Min, Max, Mean, Standard Deviation, Z-Score, Duration, POS IDs

The columns for the labels are Prominence, and Boundary
