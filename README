Go to Model Retraining to get to the code to retrain the models.

There are two folders that are needed. A folder for pitch CSVs, and a folder for intensity CSVs.
The CSVs that are created with the model will run fine with this code. 

The columns for the features in the CSVs are:
Min, Max, Mean, Standard Deviation, Z-Score, Duration, POS IDs

The columns for the labels are Prominence, and Boundary.

The RPT_2CSV folder is for prepping the data. If you wish you change what features the CSVs have to train the model with you can incorporate them there. If you're fine with the features currently used, feel free to ignore those files.

The models in this repo are the most recent ones that the team trained.
