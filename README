Go to Model Retraining to get to the code to retrain the models.

You must fix the paths, they are currently set to my personal files.
The CSVs that are created with the model will run fine with this code. 
They have to be split into different folders. One for pitch and one for intensity.

The columns for the features in the CSVs are:
Min, Max, Mean, Standard Deviation, Z-Score, Duration, POS IDs

The columns for the labels are Prominence, and Boundary
